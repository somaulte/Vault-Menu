# Vault-Menu

**HaloVault Server Browser, currently designed for ElDewrito 0.5.1.1**

http://browser.haloshare.org/ -- to see it in action. Do not rehost without permission.

TODO for 0.6:
```
- fix multiple resolution issues, maybe use bootstrap
- add ability to favorite & revisit servers more easily
- support to organize by ping, location, host, name, etc
- make top navigation functional, and link it back to DewShare
- link actual rank & emblems within lobbies from HaloStats api
- joining locked servers doesnt work yet; planned fix for 0.6 overlay
- friends list working with fileshare, displays who's online & in which server etc
- sometype of match-making system by auto-joining non-announced servers based on HaloStats ranks
```
