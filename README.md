# Vault-Menu

**HaloVault Server Browser, currently designed for ElDewrito 0.5.1.1**

http://browser.haloshare.org/ -- to see it in action. Do not rehost without permission.

TODO for 0.6:
```
- fix resolution issues, maybe use bootstrap
- ability to favorite and revisit servers more easily
- organizing & sorting by ping, location, host, name, etc
- link actual stats & emblems within lobbies from HaloStats api
- joining locked servers doesnt work yet; planned fix for 0.6 overlay
- sometype of match-making system by auto-joining non-announced servers
- friends list working with fileshare, displays who's online & in which server etc
```
